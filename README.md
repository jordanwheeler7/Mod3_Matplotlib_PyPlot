# Matplotlib and pyplot

Complete the tasks in the Python Notebook in this repository.
To be submitted for credit, all changes must be committed and pushed to this repository (do not create your own repository unless instructed to on the course website).

## Rubric

Each question is worth two points: 

* Data plotted as described by the question (1 pt)
* Plot contains required elements (title, axis labels, axis titles, legend if required)

## Project Overview

This project starts with a frequency of characters bar graph. We then use scatter and plot functions to graph a random sequence.
We do this a second time but show how to change color and markers. Finally, we show how to plot on the same axes insertion and merge times.

## Required Libraries

collections
random
matplotlib.pyplot
